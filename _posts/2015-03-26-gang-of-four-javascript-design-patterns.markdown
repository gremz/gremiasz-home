If you've ever researched design patterns you've certainly come across the Gang of Four (GoF). While books such as [JavaScript Patterns][jdp] do a good job at explaining all of the most commonly used patterns, I've found a good, well organized and free alternative by the team at dofactory.com. They do a good job at clearly explaining the different implementations with clear examples and use cases.
